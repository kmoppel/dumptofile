dumptofile
==========

A [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator) plugin for 1-click dumping of the console contents to a text file (`~/.terminator/$datetime.log`).

One needs to copy the plugin to `/usr/share/terminator/terminatorlib/plugins/` or `~/.config/terminator/plugins/` and enable it under _Preferences_ to make the context-menu (named _DumpToFile_) appear. Dump files are stored under `~/.terminator`.

For Gtk3 versions of Terminator (ver 1.90+) use the `terminator-1.90` branch [here](https://github.com/kmoppel/dumptofile/tree/terminator-1.90).
